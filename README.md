# ShakeDraCor
This corpus comprises 37 Shakespeare plays. Our source is the fantastic [Folger Shakespeare Library](https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/) (released under the [CC BY-NC 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/deed.en_US) licence).

The texts were prepared to seemlessly integrate with the DraCor pipeline. Network extraction works out of the box. Click on any play at https://dracor.org/shake and see what happens (e.g., *[Macbeth](https://dracor.org/shake/macbeth)*).

We also added Wikidata IDs per play.
